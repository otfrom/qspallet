This is a really simple example based on the [First
Steps](http://palletops.com/doc/first-steps/) examples at the main
[pallet](http://palletops.com/) website.

Though while the current pallet documentation points to version 0.7.x,
these examples are using [pallet
0.8.0-beta.1](https://github.com/pallet/pallet) which is the latest
beta version at the time of writing and contains a number of api
changes and changes in how things should be structured generally and I
feel simplifies pallet and thus allows for more flexibility.

There are also examples of how to configure AWS, Rackspace OpenStack
in London and GreenQloud in the dot-pallet directory.

I hope this helps you to understand pallet and have fun configuring
fleets of machines in the cloud.
